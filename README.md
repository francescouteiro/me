Hi there 👋<br>
I'm Frans Niccolò, a 17yold portuguese citizen.

For whatever reason that brought you here, welcome to my github profile. I hope you're having a decent day.<br>
I'm an on-going highschool student, at Portugal, simultaneously self-learning how to programme.

🌱 I’m currently learning from various sources, including the Full-Stack path from Codecademy Pro Subscription.<br>
🤝 I’m already open to work and discussing any professional opportunities, directly or throught WebsiteThis (check out socials for + info).
