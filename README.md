Hi there 👋 
I'm Frans Niccolò, a 17yold portuguese citizen.

For whatever reason that brought you here, welcome to my github profile. I hope you're having a decent day. 
I'm an on-going highschool student, at Portugal, simultaneously self-learning how to programme.

🌱 I’m currently learning from various sources, including the Full-Stack path from Codecademy Pro Subscription.
🤝 I’m already open to work and discussing any professional opportunities.
